g3Observable
============

A javascript object that implements the observer or pub/sub pattern.

It implements the observer pattern or a publish-subscribe system based on subjects and functions registered under them.
<ul>
<li>The registration signature is: <code>register(func, subject, context)</code>.<br />
If <code>'subject'</code> is ommited then it's <code>'g3'</code>, if <code>'context'</code> is omitted then function is called as usual otherwise it changes context and runs under the new one. A function can register under many subjects. It can be chained.</li>
<li>The unregister signature is: <code>unregister(func, subject, context)</code>.<br />
It breaks the chain and returns the number of unregistered functions.</li>
<li>Our functions signature is: <code>function ([subject, arg1, arg2, ...])</code>.<br />
When a message is fired for a specific subject then, all registered functions are called and an array is passed to them constructed from the arguments of the notify function.</li>
<li><code>notify(subject)</code><br />
It breaks the chain and returns the number of the functions it calls. If there are no registered functions under this subject then, it returns false.</li>
<li><code>get(subject)</code><br />
breaks the chain and returns the array of objects <code>[{function, context}, ...]</code> under a subject or the object of all subjects if subject is null: <code>{length: n, subject1: [{function, context}, ...], ...}</code>.</li>
<li>reset()<br />
converts the object of all subjects to: <code>{length: 0}</code>. It can be chained.</li>
</ul>

This version uses publisher or observable to <b>push</b> notification messages to observers in contrast of a <b>pull</b> system where every observer queries the observable.

Purpose
=======
It will become part of our javascript plugin extension mechanism using object mixin techniques and allowing the user to extend the behaviour of any (jQuery, whatever) plugin with the help of a class library.

Testing
=======
The <code>g3.evaluator</code> is used to test functioning behaviour of this object along with jasmine v.2.0.

<h3>How our code is constructed?</h3>
<pre>
my source files (g3), necessary libraries (jquery) and my tests folder (tests):
      client
        :
        |-jquery
        :  :
        |-g3
        :  |- <g3MyClass.js>
        :  :
        |-tests
        :  |-jasmine-standalone-2.0.0
           |  |-lib
           |  |-spec
           :  :
           |-g3
           :  |- <g3MyClass-SpecRunner.html>
              |- <g3MyClass-Spec.js>
              |- <g3MyClass-SpecHelper.js>
              |- g3evaluator.css
              |- g3evaluator.js
              |- g3evaluator.html (rename this file to test-g3MyClass.html)
              |- <test-g3MyClass.html>
              :
</pre>

There are two <code>g3</code> folders: the one contains the actual code and the other under <code>tests</code> contains the test files.

<h3>Do you need help?</h3>
<h4>Yesss please!</h4> Jasmine is a tough animal to handle!

Have fun!
